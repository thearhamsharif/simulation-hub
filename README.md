A state-of-the-art **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** tool designed for modeling, analyzing, and optimizing complex workflows using queuing theory. This tool provides researchers, analysts, and managers with real-time visual analytics and cost-effective decision-making support.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Comprehensive Queuing Models**:
  - **Markovian Models**: M/M/1, M/M/c, M/M/1/K, M/M/c/K.
  - **General Service Models**: M/G/1, M/G/c, M/D/1.
  - **General Arrival/Service Models**: G/G/1, G/G/c.
- **Advanced Priority Systems**:
  - Support for **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**.
  - **Non-Preemptive Priority (NP)**: Higher priority customers jump the queue but don't interrupt service.
  - **Preemptive Priority (PR)**: Higher priority customers can interrupt ongoing service sessions.
- **Cost Optimization Analysis**:
  - Calculate total simulation costs based on server operational costs and customer waiting costs.
- **Real-Time Visual Analytics**:
  - **Multi-Server Gantt Charts**: Track server usage and idle patterns.
  - **Queue Timeline plots**: Visualize queue length fluctuations over time.
  - **Metric Breakdowns**: Detailed bars and scatter plots for Wait Time, Service Time, and Response Time.
- **Theoretical Comparison**: Automated comparison between simulated data and theoretical steady-state results.

## 🛠️ Technical Background

The simulator is built using a **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** engine implemented in Vanilla JavaScript. 

- **State Management**: Uses a custom DES loop tracking arrivals and completion events to jump through simulation time efficiently.
- **Distributions**: Supports Exponential (Poisson), Uniform, Deterministic, and Normal distributions using mathematical transforms (e.g., Box-Muller for Normal distribution).
- **Stability Analysis**: Built-in stability checks ($\rho < 1$) for infinite capacity models to ensure physical feasibility.
- **Precision Handling**: Implements floating-point precision guards (`Math.max(0, ...)` logic) to ensure accurate time metric reporting.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

- **Premium Glassmorphism**: High-end aesthetic with frosted-glass effects and subtle depth.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for desktop and tablets for professional use-cases.
- **Micro-animations**: Smooth transitions and interactive chart hover states for enhanced data exploration.
